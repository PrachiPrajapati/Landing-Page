                        <h2><span>4.</span>	CONTRACTS BETWEEN CLIENTS AND GIGWORKERS</h2>
                        <p>Users of the Gigify Platform hereby acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to the terms of a Gig to be performed by a GigWorker for a Client, both the Client and the GigWorker are lawfully entering into a legally binding Service Agreement for the performance of a service. In executing such Service Agreement, both Users warrant that they shall comply with the Service Agreement and this Agreement before, during and after execution of the service. </p>
                        <p>Any GigWorker who uses, or attempts to use, the Gigify Platform for the purposes of connecting with Clients and performing Gigs for the purpose of receiving remuneration, does so of his own volition and on an independent basis. </p>
                        <p>The terms of Service Agreement entered into between Client and GigWorker shall implicitly include those warranties set out in Section 3 of these Terms of Service, but may otherwise include any lawful contractual terms which may be set out and accepted by both the GigWorker and the Client so far as these do not violate any of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Gigs may not be delegated, shared, assigned, or sub-contracted by the GigWorker to any third-party, and must be performed solely and exclusively.</p>
                        <p>The Client shall pay the GigWorker for the completed Gig through the portal available on the Gigify Platform, which amount shall be defined in accordance with the terms of the Service Agreement agreed upon and entered into between the Client and GigWorker. </p>
                        <p>The Company shall not be a party to such Service Agreement, and neither shall any agreement expand or restrict the rights of the Company pursuant to this Agreement. The role of the Company shall be limited to its role in acting as a payment collection agent, and thereby facilitating the payment of the GigWorker by collecting payment from the Client through the Gigify Platform and re-distributing it to the GigWorker once both parties confirm that the task has been executed. For the avoidance of doubt, upon a task being completed by the Gigworker, the GigWorker shall mark the Gig as complete , which shall prompt an automatic invoice to be sent to the Client. The Client is then notified to review the invoice and effect payment to the GigWorker.</p>
                        <p>No Service Agreement between a Client and GigWorker shall, under any circumstances, create a relationship of employment between a User and the Company, or between a GigWorker and a Client.</p>
                        <p>No Users shall, in any instance whatsoever, have any authority to enter into any agreement for or on behalf of the Company in any way or form. The Users hereby agree to notify the Company of any disputes arising out of Service Agreements which were facilitated by the Gigify Platform, at least thirty (30) days prior to initiating any legal proceedings whatsoever. The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate any incomplete service or account relating to a dispute.</p>
                        <h2><span>5.</span> BILLING AND PAYMENT</h2>
                        <p>Once a Gig has been marked as complete by the GigWorker on the Website or the App, an automatic invoice will be generated for the review, and if necessary amendment by the GigWorker (the “Invoice”). At this stage, the GigWorker may also include any expenses for any agreed upon costs for materials or other resources required in order to fulfil the Gig (“Out of Pocket Expenses”). Clients and GigWorkers undertake to communicate and agree on Out of Pocket Expenses via the Platform Chat.</p>
                        <p>The Client shall then be notified to review the Invoice and ultimately effect payment to the GigWorker. The mode of payment through which Clients shall pay GigWorkers for the performance of each Gig shall be by means of a credit card via the Website or the App. The Clients will be required to provide their payment method details, more specifically their name, surname, bank account number, credit card expiry date and the card security code (“CVV”). The Gigworker shall be required to provide the name, surname and bank account number for payment to be effected. </p>
                        <p>The Client shall be responsible for paying the Invoice which shall include the pricing terms of the Gig provided by the GigWorker and agreed upon by and between the Parties, any Out of Pocket Expenses and the company service charge.</p>
